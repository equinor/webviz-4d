WebViz-4D is built on webviz-subsurface, but has been customized to only display maps showing timelapse differences.

In this setup we have configured several menu options:

- Documentation

- Table with wellbore overview
- Interactive plotting of injected and produced volumes
- Tables with production volumes in 4D intervals
- Table with injection volumes in 4D intervals
