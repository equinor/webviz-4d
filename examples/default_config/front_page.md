### Welcome to the webviz-4D example application

Welcome to this example application, which is based on an openly available
[Reek output test dataset](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata)
and [Webviz-4D](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-config).

#### User groups targeted by Webviz

These are the main user groups targeted by [*Webviz*]((https://github.com/equinor/webviz-config)):

  - **You only want to go to a web page**
    - ...and see the results from your project. Ask one person belonging to the next
      user group to set it up for your project.
  - **You do not know scripting**
    - ...and only want to add different predefined dashboards or
      visualizations/components in a certain order and/or on different pages in the
      application. Optionally with some text and mathematical equations (that you provide)
      inbetween the  dashboards, explaining what the user is looking at.
  - **You know [Python](https://www.python.org/)**
    - ..and want to create generic or specialized dashboards you or other users can reuse
      by simply asking for it in the Webviz configuration file. This can be done without
      knowing JavaScript (see also [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) for more information).
  - **You know [React](https://reactjs.org/)**
    - ..and want to create highly specialized visualization which Python
      or pure config-file users can reuse.
